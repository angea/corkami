v0.14 - December 2020:
 - Python 3
 - ASCII is using a threshold - too many FPs
 - Zero display is using a threshold - too many FPs
 - no more alpha character
 - Hex ruler at the bottom
 - dots interleave line is displayed after a skip
 - gap size displayed
 - fixed ruler with different line length
 - ANSI colors, themes
 - charsets
 - filename and hash
 - arguments parsing
 - Ansi style optimisation
 - style propagation over nibbles
 - compact mode via alternating backgrounds, only when needed

v0.13 - April 2014:
 Hex:
 - ASCII chars are replaced as .<char>
   (optionally in colors)
 - 00 is replaced by "  "
 - FF is replaced by "##"
 - other chars are returned as hex

 Output:
 - a hex ruler is shown at the top of the 'display'
 - offsets don't contain superfluous 0
 - offsets are removed identical starting characters if following the previous
 - lines full of 00 are skipped
 - offsets after a skip are fully written
 - Last_Offset+1 is marked with "]"
   (because EOF could be absent)
